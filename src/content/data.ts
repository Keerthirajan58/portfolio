/**
 * content/data.ts
 *
 * Phase 0 content extraction for the portfolio rebuild.
 *
 * Every fact in this file was copied from the legacy Bootstrap site in this
 * repo (index.html, about.html, resume.html, portfolio.html, contact.html,
 * portfolio-details.html, and the project-*.html case-study pages) as it
 * existed on 2026-07-14. Nothing here was invented, embellished, or
 * "improved." Where the source itself was vague, incomplete, or internally
 * inconsistent, that vagueness/inconsistency was preserved and is called out
 * in a comment at the point of use.
 *
 * The content-extractor agent's first pass flagged several ambiguities to
 * the site owner (GitHub handle inconsistency, missing publication details,
 * location/email variants, etc.); their answers on 2026-07-14 are reflected
 * directly in the data below, with the resolution noted in-line where it
 * isn't self-evident.
 *
 * The only normalization applied anywhere in this file is whitespace
 * collapsing (the legacy HTML hard-wraps long <li> text across source lines).
 * No words, numbers, dates, titles, or names were changed, reordered, or
 * corrected beyond the owner's explicit corrections above.
 *
 * Phase 3 update (2026-07-14): image/resume paths were repointed from the
 * legacy `assets/...` locations to the real files now under `/public`
 * (`/images/...`, `/Keerthirajan-Senthilkumar-Resume.pdf`). Project galleries
 * were updated to the actual screenshots the owner supplied (real counts,
 * imageStatus "real"), and BarterBrAIn's gallery/impact now include the GW
 * New Venture Competition recognition. These are real assets, not fabrications.
